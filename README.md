SRT File Processor is a tool for editing and managing .srt subtitle files. It allows you to add periods to subtitle lines, separate timestamps from text, and reattach translated content to the original timestamps. This is useful for translating subtitles with ChatGPT by processing the full text instead of line-by-line.
